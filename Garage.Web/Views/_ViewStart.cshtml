@*
    Razor pages have a Property named Layout.
    Individual Views specify a Layout by setting this property.
    A _ViewStart.cshtml file is going to be called automatically when MVC is rendering the View.
    In the _ViewStart file you can add code that you want executed by every View.
*@
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
